As set forth in our Copyright Policy, Heyu will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement.  A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to Heyu’ Copyright Agent at dmca@rapgenius.com (Subject line:  “DMCA Takedown Request”).  You may also contact us by mail at:

To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:
an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;
a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site or Service, with enough detail that we may find it on the Website;

a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner‘s behalf.
Counter-Notice: If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to post and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;

If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, Heyu will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
        Repeat Infringer Policy:  In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Heyu has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at Heyu's sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

Disclaimer of Warranties
YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE WEBSITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. Heyu EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
Heyu MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT (I) THE WEBSITE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, (II) THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, (III) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE WEBSITE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE, OR (IV) THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL PURCHASED OR OBTAINED BY YOU THROUGH THE WEBSITE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS.
Limitation of Liability
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Heyu SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Heyu HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OR FROM THE WEBSITE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA BY ANY PARTY; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE WEBSITE; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE WEBSITE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE WEBSITE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF WEBSITE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE WEBSITE.
Arbitration
At Heyu’ election and in its sole discretion, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Website that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS, and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless specifically modified in these Terms.  The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party.  The arbitrator’s decision and award shall be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator.  The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.  The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding.  Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.  The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Termination
In addition to the termination rights set forth elsewhere herein, you agree that Heyu, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Website and remove and discard any content within the Website, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Heyu believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Website may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Heyu may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Website, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Website under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Heyu may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Website. Further, you agree that Heyu shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
User Disputes
You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Website and Heyu will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.  Heyu reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Website or to elect to display only certain of the User content submitted in connection with a particular Heyu subdomain.
General
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Heyu and govern your use of the Website, superseding any prior agreements between you and Heyu with respect to the Website. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Heyu agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California.  The failure of Heyu to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Website or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Website may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
