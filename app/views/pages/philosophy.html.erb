      <li>The best way to learn a new language? <strong>Immerse yourself!</strong></li>
      <br>
      <li>If you can't hop on a plane to where the language is spokenâ€”<strong>listen to music</strong> and <strong>watch videos</strong> in the language.</li>
      <br>
      <li>If your goal is to interact with the living language and culture, the best content to listen to is <strong>current, relevant, and popular.</strong></li>
    </ol>
